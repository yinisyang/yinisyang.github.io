		<h3>Chernobyl Disaster</h3>
		<p>The Chernobyl Disaster was a catastrophic nuclear meltdown that occurred at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine under the direct authority of the Soviet Government on April 26, 1986. The explosion that followed the meltdown sent radioactive fallout over much of the western part of the USSR and much of Europe. This incident is considered a class 7 meltdown, one of only two in human history, the other being the recent disaster in Fukushima, Japan. Over 500,000 workers were able to contain the disaster and avoided an even greater catastrophe that might have occurred. The effects of the radiation on the workers who contained it and the general population of the area is still being investigated to this day.</p>
		<h3>Crimean Invasion</h3>
		<p>The Crimean peninsula is internationally recognized as an autonomous province of Ukraine. However in March of 2014 this region was annexed by Russia. This took place in the aftermath of the Ukrainian revolution in early 2014 when Russia decided to intervene in the Crimean Peninsula militarily and decided "we must start working on returning Crimea to Russia." which is a direct quote from Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia. According to many worldwide sources on February 27, 2014 masked green troops without insignias took over the supreme council of Crimea and installed a pro-Russian government. These troops were later identified as the Russian Armed Forces. This has been condemned by many world leaders and is seen as an illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory. Russia denies it was an annexation because they say there was a referendum for independence from Ukraine that passed with 96% in favor though many dispute its legitimacy. The United States does not currently recognize the annexation of Crimea.</p>
		<h3>Ukrainian Revolution</h3>
		<p>In November 2013 tens of thousand of protesters took to the street of Kiev and other cities to protests the governments decision to not sign an association agreement with the EU and bowing to Russian pressure. In February 2014 77 protesters are killed by security forces. The protesters soon took over government buildings and President Yanukovych fled to Russia while the opposition installed President Olexander Turchynov and acting prime minister Arseny Yatseniuk which Russia does not recognize as official.</p>

		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<p>While Ukraine was a part of the USSR it was the second most important economically; only behind Russia. It generated about four times the output of the next highest member. After Ukraine achieved independence in 1991 started to reform and erect a framework for privitization. Resistance to these reforms led to some backtracking of the economy which, in 1999, had fallen to just 40% of the 1991 level. Because of this Ukraine has become heavily dependent on imports from other countries, especially Russia.</p>
